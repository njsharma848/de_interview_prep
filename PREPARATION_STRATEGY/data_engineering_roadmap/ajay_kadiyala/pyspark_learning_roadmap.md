# PySpark Learning Roadmap for 2026

In 2026, PySpark is still a high-paying skill, because Apache Spark is hard...

Most people learn PySpark from random tutorials. Then they struggle with joins, shuffles, and slow jobs in real projects.

## The Roadmap

All you need is...

### 1️⃣ Spark Basics
Driver/executors, lazy evaluation

### 2️⃣ DataFrames + Spark SQL
Joins, windows, read/write Parquet

### 3️⃣ Partitions + File Sizes
Small files problem, repartition vs coalesce

### 4️⃣ Performance Tuning ⚠️
Shuffles, skew, broadcast joins

### 5️⃣ Incremental Loads
Daily loads, idempotency, late data

### 6️⃣ Lakehouse Basics
Delta tables, merge/upsert, schema evolution

### 7️⃣ Production Mindset
Logging, retries, monitoring, cost

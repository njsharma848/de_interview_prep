# 10 Hacks to Get 10x Better at SQL and Python

## 1. Master SELECT with Purpose

Don't just write `SELECT *`; practice retrieving only relevant columns and rows. It trains your mind to think like a data analyst solving business queries.

## 2. Rewrite Real Business Queries

Take case studies (e.g., "Top-selling products per region") and write multiple SQL solutions (with and without CTEs, window functions).

## 3. Create Your Own Database

Use dummy data (from Kaggle or generate with Python) to build a mock e-commerce or banking database in PostgreSQL or MySQL and write queries daily.

## 4. Practice with Time-Series SQL

Product companies love asking time-based questions (like weekly retention or daily active users). Get comfortable with `DATE_TRUNC`, `GROUP BY time`, and lagging trends.

## 5. Optimize Like an Engineer

Don't just solve queries—optimize them. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see how your query performs and learn about indexing and subquery performance.

## 6. Daily SQL Challenge Habit

Spend 30–45 mins daily on platforms like StrataScratch, InterviewQuery, or Mode Analytics SQL tutorials, focusing on real-world problems.

## 7. Think in Joins, Not Tables

When faced with a question, don't ask "What table?"—ask "How do these tables relate?" Mastering joins is key to solving multi-table business queries.

## 8. Track Your Mistakes

Maintain a "SQL Misses Log"—every time a query fails or a platform rejects your solution, log what went wrong and rewrite a cleaner version.

## 9. Learn Through Projects, Not Just Syntax

Build micro-projects like:
- Customer churn predictor
- Price optimization model
- Data pipeline using Pandas + SQLite

## 10. Master Pandas Beyond Basics

Go deep into:
- `.groupby().agg()`
- `.merge()` vs `.join()`
- `apply()` + lambda use cases
- Performance tuning with `.loc[]` and `.query()`

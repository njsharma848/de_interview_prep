**Interview Introduction**

"Hi, I'm Sai Sanath Erram, a Data Engineer with over 5 years of experience building scalable data pipelines and real-time processing systems across gaming, financial services, and telecommunications industries.

Currently, I'm working as a Senior Engineer at Altimetrik, where I'm building event-driven ETL orchestration systems for New York Life Investment Management. I've architected serverless data pipelines using AWS Step Functions, Lambda, and EventBridge that automate CSV ingestion into Redshift. Recently, I redesigned their Redshift data model, consolidating 13 tables into 7 optimized tables, which significantly reduced join complexity and improved query performance for their analytics workloads.

Before this, I spent two years at Sony India Software Center working on the PlayStation Network, where I built an automated ETL framework processing daily gaming telemetry data. I designed PySpark transformations implementing SCD Type 2 logic for maintaining player profile dimensions and optimized Redshift queries to achieve sub-second response times on high-volume session data.

I also have experience with real-time streaming architectures from my time at Synechron, working with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, where I built data quality monitoring systems using Kinesis Data Analytics and developed batch validation frameworks using PySpark and Great Expectations.

Early in my career at Quanted Technologies, I gained solid experience with DynamoDB, where I designed and optimized table schemas with efficient partition keys and Global Secondary Indexes for high-throughput, low-latency access patterns. I handled capacity planning with Auto Scaling and integrated DynamoDB with PySpark-based ETL pipelines for reliable data ingestion.

My core technical expertise includes Python, PySpark, Apache Spark, and the AWS data engineering stack—particularly Glue, Lambda, Step Functions, Redshift, Kinesis, and DynamoDB. I'm comfortable with both batch and streaming architectures, and I focus on building production-grade systems with proper monitoring, error handling, and data quality controls.

I hold an MTech in Computer Science from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and I'm AWS Certified as a Data Engineer Associate.

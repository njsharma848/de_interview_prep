# Don't Learn Databricks (At Least Not Yet)

Before Databricks, learn the fundamentals.

## Learn SQL First
Because every data problem eventually becomes a query.

## Learn Python
Because pipelines, transformations, automation, and ML all depend on it.

## Learn Spark
Because Databricks is not magic. It is Spark with a managed platform.

## Why Fundamentals Matter

Databricks does not teach you fundamentals. It only exposes them.

If you jump straight to Databricks without understanding:
- SQL execution
- Python logic
- How Spark actually works

You will struggle the moment something breaks.

**Buttons won't save you.**

**Notebooks won't save you.**

**Auto-scaling won't save you.**

But if you know SQL, Python, and Spark, Databricks becomes **powerful** instead of **confusing**.

## The Truth About Platforms

Platforms change. Foundations don't.

So don't rush to learn Databricks. **Build the basics first.**

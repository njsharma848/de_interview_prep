# Practice Exercise: Ride-Hailing App Data Model

## The Scenario

A ride-hailing app (like Uber or Ola) operates as follows:

1. A **rider** opens the app and books a trip from their home to their office
2. The app assigns a **driver** who accepts the ride
3. The driver picks up the rider at the **pickup location**
4. The driver drives the rider to their **destination**
5. The rider pays for the trip (base fare + distance + time + surge pricing)
6. The rider can rate the driver and leave a tip

---

## Your Task

Before looking at the solution below, try to answer these questions:

### Question 1: What are the FACTS?
Think about the **numbers** that the business would want to measure and analyze.

**Hints:**
- What metrics involve money?
- What metrics involve time?
- What metrics involve distance?
- What other numeric measurements matter?

---

### Question 2: What are the DIMENSIONS?
Think about the **context** needed to slice and dice those facts.

**Hints:**
- **Who** is involved in this transaction?
- **When** did this happen?
- **Where** did this happen?
- **What** type of ride was it?
- **How** was payment made?

---

### Question 3: What is the GRAIN?
What does **ONE ROW** in your fact table represent?

**Think about these options:**
- One complete ride (from pickup to dropoff)?
- One mile driven?
- One minute of the trip?
- One pickup event?
- One payment transaction?

**Which one makes the most business sense?**

## Solution

### GRAIN Definition

**Fact_Rides Grain**: One row = One completed ride from pickup to dropoff

**Why this grain?**
- Most business questions are at the ride level
- "What was total revenue today?" (sum all ride_amounts)
- "What's the average trip duration?" (average all durations)
- "How many rides did each driver complete?" (count rows per driver)

**Alternative grains we could consider:**
- **One mile driven**: Good for detailed distance analysis, but too granular for most business questions
- **One driver shift**: Too aggregated, loses detail about individual rides
- **One payment**: Might need this as a separate fact table if you want to track payment processing separately

---

### FACTS (Measures)

These are the **numeric values** we want to analyze:

| Fact | Data Type | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `fare_amount` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Base fare charged to rider |
| `distance_miles` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Total distance traveled |
| `duration_minutes` | INT | Total time from pickup to dropoff |
| `surge_multiplier` | DECIMAL(4,2) | Surge pricing multiplier (e.g., 1.5x, 2.0x) |
| `tip_amount` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Tip given by rider |
| `toll_amount` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Tolls paid during the ride |
| `tax_amount` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Taxes charged |
| `total_amount` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Total charged to rider |
| `driver_earnings` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Amount paid to driver |
| `company_commission` | DECIMAL(10,2) | Company's cut of the fare |
| `wait_time_minutes` | INT | Time rider waited for pickup |
| `rider_rating` | DECIMAL(3,2) | Rating given by rider (1-5) |
| `driver_rating` | DECIMAL(3,2) | Rating given by driver (1-5) |

**Why these are facts:**
- All are numeric
- All can be aggregated (summed, averaged, counted)
- All answer "how much" or "how many"

---

### DIMENSIONS (Context)

These provide the **context** for analyzing those facts:

#### 1. Dim_Rider (Who requested the ride?)

## Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tracking Cancelled Rides

**Should cancelled rides be in the same fact table?**

**Option A**: Yes, keep them in Fact_Rides with a status field
```sql
WHERE f.ride_status IN ('Completed', 'Cancelled', 'No-Show')
```

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth
- Easy to analyze cancellation rates
- Complete ride request history

**Cons:**
- Cancelled rides have NULL values for many facts (no distance, duration, payment)
- Can skew averages if not filtered properly

**Option B**: Create a separate Fact_Ride_Requests table
```sql
-- All ride requests
CREATE TABLE Fact_Ride_Requests (
    request_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_key INT,
    requested_date_key INT,
    request_status VARCHAR(20),  -- Matched, Cancelled, Expired
    ...
);

-- Only completed rides
CREATE TABLE Fact_Completed_Rides (
    ride_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);
```

**Best Practice**: Use Option A for simplicity, but always filter by status in queries.

---

### Scenario 2: Shared Rides (Multiple Riders)

**Problem**: One ride can have multiple riders!

**Solution**: Use a Bridge Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Bridge_Ride_Riders (
    ride_id BIGINT REFERENCES Fact_Rides(ride_id),
    rider_key INT REFERENCES Dim_Rider(rider_key),
    pickup_sequence INT,              -- Which rider was picked up first?
    individual_fare DECIMAL(10,2),    -- How much did this rider pay?
    pickup_location_key INT,
    dropoff_location_key INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (ride_id, rider_key)
);
```

**Query**: Total revenue from shared rides
```sql
SELECT 
    f.ride_id,
    COUNT(b.rider_key) as total_riders,
    SUM(b.individual_fare) as total_fare_collected
FROM Fact_Rides f
JOIN Bridge_Ride_Riders b ON f.ride_id = b.ride_id
WHERE f.ride_type_key = (SELECT ride_type_key FROM Dim_Ride_Type WHERE ride_type_name = 'Shared')
GROUP BY f.ride_id;
```

---

### Scenario 3: SCD Type 2 for Drivers

**Problem**: Driver ratings change over time. You want historical accuracy.

**Solution**: Implement SCD Type 2 on Dim_Driver

```sql
CREATE TABLE Dim_Driver (
    driver_key INT PRIMARY KEY,          -- Surrogate key (changes)
    driver_id INT,                       -- Business key (same)
    driver_name VARCHAR(100),
    avg_driver_rating DECIMAL(3,2),     -- This changes!
    effective_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    is_current BOOLEAN
);
```

**Sample Data**:
```
driver_key | driver_id | driver_name | avg_driver_rating | effective_date | end_date   | is_current
2001       | D001      | John Kumar  | 4.7              | 2023-01-01     | 2023-12-31 | FALSE
2002       | D001      | John Kumar  | 4.9              | 2024-01-01     | 9999-12-31 | TRUE
```

**Query**: Compare driver rating at time of ride vs. current rating
```sql
SELECT 
    f.ride_id,
    d_historical.driver_name,
    d_historical.avg_driver_rating as rating_when_ride_happened,
    d_current.avg_driver_rating as current_rating,
    (d_current.avg_driver_rating - d_historical.avg_driver_rating) as rating_improvement
FROM Fact_Rides f
JOIN Dim_Driver d_historical 
    ON f.driver_key = d_historical.driver_key
JOIN Dim_Driver d_current 
    ON d_historical.driver_id = d_current.driver_id 
    AND d_current.is_current = TRUE;
```

## Optimization for Redshift

### 1. Distribution Key Strategy

```sql
-- Distribute by rider_key (most common join pattern)
CREATE TABLE Fact_Rides (
    ...
)
DISTKEY(rider_key);

-- Distribute small dimension tables to all nodes
CREATE TABLE Dim_Ride_Type (
    ...
)
DISTSTYLE ALL;
```

### 2. Sort Key Strategy

```sql
-- Sort by date and time (most common filters)
CREATE TABLE Fact_Rides (
    ...
)
SORTKEY(pickup_date_key, pickup_time_key);
```

### 3. Compression

```sql
-- Analyze table to apply automatic compression
ANALYZE COMPRESSION Fact_Rides;

-- Apply compression
CREATE TABLE Fact_Rides (
    ride_id BIGINT ENCODE ZSTD,
    pickup_date_key INT ENCODE DELTA,
    fare_amount DECIMAL(10,2) ENCODE AZ64,
    ...
);
```

## Variations to Consider

### Alternative Grain 1: Fact_Ride_Events
**Grain**: One row = One event in the ride lifecycle

```
event_id | ride_id | event_type      | event_timestamp      | location_key
1        | R12345  | Request         | 2024-01-12 08:00:00 | 3001
2        | R12345  | Driver Assigned | 2024-01-12 08:02:00 | NULL
3        | R12345  | Pickup          | 2024-01-12 08:15:00 | 3001
4        | R12345  | Dropoff         | 2024-01-12 08:50:00 | 3002
```

**Use case**: Detailed tracking of ride lifecycle, wait time analysis

---

### Alternative Grain 2: Fact_Driver_Shifts
**Grain**: One row = One driver shift

```sql
CREATE TABLE Fact_Driver_Shifts (
    shift_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    driver_key INT,
    shift_date_key INT,
    start_time_key INT,
    end_time_key INT,
    rides_completed INT,
    total_distance_miles DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_duration_minutes INT,
    total_earnings DECIMAL(10,2),
    online_minutes INT,
    idle_minutes INT
);
```

**Use case**: Driver performance and earnings analysis

## Key Learnings Summary

### 1. The Grain is Critical
- Defines what one row represents
- Must be clearly stated
- All facts must be at this grain level

### 2. Multiple Date/Time Dimensions
- Pickup date/time vs Dropoff date/time
- Both are needed for complete analysis

### 3. Multiple Location Dimensions
- Pickup location vs Dropoff location
- Cannot use a single location dimension

### 4. Bridge Tables for Many-to-Many
- Shared rides = multiple riders per ride
- Bridge table handles this elegantly

### 5. Degenerate Dimensions
- Simple attributes like status don't need their own dimension table
- Store directly in fact table

### 6. Star Schema Simplifies Queries
- All dimensions connect directly to fact
- Fewer joins = better performance

## Your Next Steps

1. **Draw the star schema** on paper - helps visualize relationships
2. **Write 5 business questions** you want to answer
3. **Write SQL queries** for those questions
4. **Think about edge cases**: What happens with cancelled rides? Shared rides? Refunds?
5. **Consider SCD strategies**: Which attributes need history tracking?

## Challenge Exercise 

Now try designing a data model for one of these:

1. **E-commerce**: Orders, Products, Customers, Shipments
2. **Healthcare**: Patient visits, Diagnoses, Treatments, Billing
3. **Banking**: Transactions, Accounts, Customers, Branches
4. **Streaming Service**: Views, Content, Users, Devices

Pick one and work through the same process:
- Define the grain
- Identify facts
- Identify dimensions
- Design the star schema
- Write sample queries

Good luck! 🚀

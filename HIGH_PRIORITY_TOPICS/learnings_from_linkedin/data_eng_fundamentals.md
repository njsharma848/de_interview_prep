I spent 𝗺𝘆 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 trying to learn everything, which ultimately slowed my growth more than any technical gap.

In the beginning, I was focused on mastering Spark, Kafka, Airflow, ADF, Snowflake, and more all at once. 

While I gained a broad understanding, I struggled with deep debugging and confident optimization. This became evident during interviews.

What actually worked for me was focusing on a few key areas:

1. SQL
   - Not just queries, but execution plans, indexes, and data modeling.

2. One compute engine (Spark / Databricks)
   - Understanding partitions, shuffles, memory management, and performance tuning.

3. One cloud stack
   - Mastering ADF, ADLS, monitoring, cost management, and failure handling.

Here are seven essential things to learn as your primary Data Engineering stack:

1. Advanced SQL
   - Joins, window functions, execution plans, indexing, and data modeling.
2. One compute engine (Spark / Databricks)
   - Focus on partitions, shuffles, skew, memory, and performance tuning.
3. Data ingestion patterns
   - Batch vs incremental, CDC basics, and handling late-arriving data.
4. Pipeline orchestration
   - Managing dependencies, retries, idempotency, and backfills.
5. Data modeling for analytics
   - Understanding fact tables, dimensions, and slowly changing dimensions (SCD).
6. Monitoring & alerting
   - Knowing what failed, why it failed, and who gets notified.
7. Cost & performance optimization
   - Cluster sizing, job tuning, and storage formats.

1. **I am working with two PySpark files where *File-A* creates a SparkSession. How can I import or reference this existing SparkSession in *File-B* to avoid creating duplicate sessions and ensure I'm working with the same Spark context?**

2. **Given a poorly performing SQL statement, how would you approach its optimization? Consider aspects such as query execution plans, indexing strategies, join operations, and query rewriting techniques in your answer.**

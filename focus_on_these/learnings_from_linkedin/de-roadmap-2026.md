# Career Roadmap: Sr. Data Engineer Switch in 2026

In 2024 I switched to a Sr. Data Engineer, but if I had to switch again in 2026, I'd follow a very different roadmap.

I made a successful jump from TCS & crossed 25+ LPA. The roadmap I followed worked, but the industry isn't what it used to be 2 yrs back.

So, if I were preparing for a switch today, this is the roadmap I'd follow 👇

## Step 1: SQL (Still the first filter in interviews)

- Advanced joins, subqueries, and query optimization
- CTEs and window functions
- Designing analytics-friendly schemas

## Step 2: Python (For production pipelines, not scripts)

- Writing clean, modular pipeline code
- Pandas + Arrow basics
- Logging, testing, and error handling

## Step 3: Distributed Processing (Beyond basic Spark)

- Spark internals, partitioning, and shuffle optimization
- Batch + streaming unification
- CDC-based pipelines
- Production deployments on Databricks

## Step 4: Streaming & Real-Time Data (Now expected)

- Kafka / PubSub fundamentals
- Event-time vs processing-time
- Late data handling and exactly-once concepts

## Step 5: Data Modeling, Quality & Governance

- Analytical vs operational modeling
- SCDs in modern pipelines
- Data contracts and schema evolution
- Data quality checks and observability

## Step 6: Cloud-Native Architecture

- Cost-aware pipeline design
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics)
- Orchestration with Airflow or managed schedulers
- Secure access and secrets management

## Step 7: Projects (This is what moves your LPA)

- 1 batch + streaming hybrid pipeline
- 1 near real-time analytics system
- 1 production-style, cloud-native project

This was just not it, but what really made the difference for me was also, mentorship, structured preparation, & staying consistent alongside a full-time job 🙌🏼

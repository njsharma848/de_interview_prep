# If You're a Fresher Trying to Break Into Data Engineering

**Stop watching tutorials and start building a pipeline.**

Certificates are great, but a hiring manager wants to see that you can solve a problem. The best way to stand out isn't another Coursera badge, it's a GitHub repo with a messy, working project.

## Try This Weekend Project

### 1. Use ChatGPT to generate four fake data sources:
- One source producing hourly CSV files
- One batch/streaming-style API source
- Two on-prem SQL Server databases with new data every 10 mins

### 2. Ingest all sources into a cloud data warehouse
(Snowflake / Synapse / Redshift)

### 3. Build idempotent pipelines that can handle:
- Schema evolution
- Backfilling historical data
- Late-arriving data using watermarks

### 4. Automate the entire workflow to run every hour

### 5. Create a unified data model across all four sources
Following a medallion architecture

### 6. Increase data volume by 10× and validate whether the pipeline still holds up

## The Bottom Line

If you can clearly explain **how** and **why** you designed this pipeline in an interview, you're already ahead of 90% of candidates.

**Get your hands dirty!**

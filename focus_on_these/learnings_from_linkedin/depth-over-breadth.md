# The Tool-Switching Trap in Data Engineering

I see many Data Engineers **switching** tools every 6 months.  
And honestly, this is silently killing careers.

New tool comes. Everyone jumps.

Spark → Snowflake → Kafka → Airflow → something else.

Resume looks impressive.  
But interviews tell a different story.

## The Real Problem

Most interview rejections don't happen because you don't know tools.  
They happen because you can't go deep when questioned.

1. Why is this pipeline slow?
2. How will you handle backfill?
3. What breaks at scale?
4. That's where tool-switching hurts.

## What Actually Works

### 1️⃣ Pick ONE primary stack
One cloud. One compute engine. One orchestration tool.

### 2️⃣ Go deep, not wide
Debug failures. Tune performance. Handle bad data.

### 3️⃣ Own production problems
Cost, alerts, SLAs, late data, retries.

### 4️⃣ Add tools later
Once fundamentals are strong, learning new tools becomes easy.

## The Bottom Line

Anyone can say "I used Spark."  
Very few can explain why a Spark job is slow and how to fix it.

That difference shows in interviews.
